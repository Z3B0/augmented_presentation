ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => unity/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => unity/src/main/assets/
* libs/QCARUnityPlayer.jar => unity/libs/QCARUnityPlayer.jar
* libs/Vuforia.jar => unity/libs/Vuforia.jar
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARUnityPlayer.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARUnityPlayer.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARWrapper.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARWrapper.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libRenderingPlugin.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libRenderingPlugin.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libVuforia.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libVuforia.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libmain.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmain.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libmono.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmono.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libunity.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libunity.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libvrunity.so => unity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libvrunity.so
* libs/libprotobuf-java-2.6-nano.jar => unity/libs/libprotobuf-java-2.6-nano.jar
* libs/unity-classes.jar => unity/libs/unity-classes.jar
* libs/unitycardboardactivity.jar => unity/libs/unitycardboardactivity.jar
* libs/unityvractivity.jar => unity/libs/unityvractivity.jar
* libs/vrtoolkit.jar => unity/libs/vrtoolkit.jar
* res/ => unity/src/main/res/
* src/ => unity/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
